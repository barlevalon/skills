A public bundle of `SKILL.md` workflows for AI-assisted engineering.

Use it when you want an agent to follow a better process for planning, debugging, TDD, review, documentation, handoff, or release prep.

## Quick start

Give your agent this repo:

```text
https://github.com/barlevalon/skills
```

If your agent needs local files instead of URLs, clone the repo and give it `skills/` or one `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barlevalon/skills.git
```

```text
skills/
skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md
skills/release/release-prep/SKILL.md
```

Ask naturally:

```text
Use TDD to implement this change.
```

```text
Diagnose this failure before fixing it.
```

```text
Prepare the next release.
```

If your agent supports npm skill packages, you can also use:

```text
@barlevalon/skills
```

## What should I use?

| Work | Skill |
|---|---|
| Shape a feature | `write-a-prd`, `prd-to-plan`, `grill-with-docs` |
| Debug a hard failure | `diagnose` |
| Build test-first | `tdd` |
| Try an idea quickly | `prototype` |
| Improve architecture | `improve-codebase-architecture` |
| Review code harshly | `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` |
| Write or clean up docs | `documentation-system` |
| Prepare a release | `release-prep` |
| Write a commit message | `caveman-commit` |
| Hand off work | `handoff` |
| Make a visual explanation | `plannotator-visual-explainer` |

See [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md) for the fuller map.
